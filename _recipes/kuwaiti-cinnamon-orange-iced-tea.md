title: "Kuwaiti Cinnamon-Orange Iced Tea"
tags: drink

ingredients:
- Tea
- 2 large pieces orange peel, orange slices for garnishing
- 1-2 small cinnamon sticks
- 8 cups water
- 8 black tea bags
- Syrup
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup sugar
- 6 ginger, quarter sized slices, peeled and chopped
- 6 Mint leaves

directions:
- Make the tea. Combine 8 cups water, the orange peel and cinnamon stick in a saucepan over low heat and bring to a boil.  Add the tea bags and turn off the heat.  Let steep for about 5 minutes (no more or it will be bitter), then remove the tea bags and chill the tea; don't remove the cinnamon stick or the orange peel yet.
- Meanwhile, make the syrup. Combine 1 cup water, the sugar and ginger in a small saucepan over low heat and bring to a boil without stirring.  Once boiling, turn off the heat.  Rip the mint leaves and stalks into pieces and drop them into the syrup.  Let cool to room temperature.  Strain the syrup, discarding the ginger and mint.
- Strain the tea into a pitcher.  Add the mint syrup and stir.  Serve in a tall glass over ice and garnish with orange slices and cinnamon sticks.
