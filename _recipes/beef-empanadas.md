title: "Beef Empanadas"
tags: dinner

ingredients:
- Dough
- 4 1/2 cups flour
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup shortening
- 1 1/4 cup water
- Filling
- 1 small onion (or to taste)
- 1 1/2 lb. ground beef
- salt and pepper (to taste)
- 2 Tbsp paprika
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1 Tbsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp hot sauce
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 1 Tbsp white vinegar
- 2 hard boiled eggs, chopped
- Olive Oil, for brushing

directions:
- In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Cut in shortening using a pastry blender, or pinching into small pieces using your fingers, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Use a fork to stir in water a few tablespoons at a time, until the mixture forms a ball. Pat into a ball, and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until tender. Crumble in the beef, and season with salt, paprika, chili powder, cumin and black pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until beef is browned then add the hot sauce. Drain excess grease, and stir in the raisins and vinegar. Let the mixture cool, then stir in the hard-cooked eggs.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
- Form the dough into 2 inch balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball out into a thin circle. Spoon some of the meat mixture onto the center, then fold into half-moon shapes. Seal edges by pressing with your fingers.
- Place empanadas on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Pull them out of the oven and brush them with olive oil and bake for an additional 8-10 minutes. They should be a golden brown.

If you do not want to make the empanada dough, you can find them in the freezer section, already premade, at the grocery store. This will save a lot of time.
