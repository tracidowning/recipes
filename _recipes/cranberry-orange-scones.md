title: "Cranberry-Orange Scones"
tags: breakfast, bread

ingredients:
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 4 cups flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup dry milk
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup butter
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp zested orange
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- Glaze
- 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1-4 tbsp orange juice, until you reach a drizzling consistancy

directions:
- Blend the sour cream and 1 tsp baking soda in a small bowl.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees (375 if using a dark cookie sheet). Instead of greasing, I always use parchment paper.
- In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, Splenda, dry milk, 1/4 tsp. baking soda, baking powder, cream of tartar, orange zest and salt. With a pastry cutter or knives, cut in the butter. Stir the sour cream mixture and egg into the flour mixture until just moistened. Mix in the cranberries.
- Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly. Pat dough into a 9" round cake pan (I do this for perfection), then carefully take the dough out and place on a wood cutting board sprinkled with flour and cut into 12 wedges, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
- Bake 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms are medium brown.
- After baking, place scones on a cooling rack with your parchment paper underneath the rack (to catch the messy glaze). Mix together the powdered sugar and OJ (you may need more OJ) until runny (almost the consistency of syrup). With a spoon...glaze the scones in a zig-zag pattern.

Dip it in your coffee in the AM...yum. Although when mixing your ingredients together you maybe tempted to add more "wet" ingredients, don't...They turn out perfect just the way they are.
