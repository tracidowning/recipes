title: "Calzones"
tags: dinner

ingredients:
- 1-1/2 lb. pizza dough (made in bread machine)
- Calzone Toppings
- pesto (enough to spread)
- 1/2 lb. sausage, cooked
- sliced mushrooms, green peppers and plum tomatoes
- onions (optional)
- spinach (optional)
- mozzarella cheese, shredded
- parmesan cheese, shredded
- 2 spoons full ricotta cheese

directions:
- Heat the oven (with baking stone in it), to 550 degrees.
- Meanwhile, roll out the dough to about 12" circle.
- Spread the pesto, then top with all of the ingredients (in order), making sure you leave a 1" parameter to "seal" the edges.
- Fold the calzone, in half, keeping all of the toppings inside and press around the edges so the cheese doesn't melt out.
- Take the pizza stone out of the oven, sprinkle with corn meal (working quickly) then place the calzones on the stone.
- Bake for 8 mins. Take out of the oven, flip and bake for an additional 7 mins.
- Make sure to let the calzone cool a little before cutting into.

A nice alternative to pizza. You can play around with the ingredients and put whatever your family likes, instead.
